Though he doesn’t have a fight booked yet, he’s happy to jump straight into a title fight on his return.\\n\\n“I’m ready to go straight for the belt, if that’s the opportunity that comes at me because I know Yan wants it.” Dillashaw told Mike Swick on the “Real Quick with Mike Swick” podcast. “He’s already been vocally talking about it and we’ll see what happens on March 6 when he fights Sterling. He’s got a tough test ahead of him, but that’s the fight he wants. I didn’t leave this sport by losing my belt. He knows there’s a lot of speculation if he’s the real champ because he hasn’t beaten the champion to get that belt, so he wants it. As well as that, I’m the biggest draw for him right now to try to fight.”\\n\\nAetna\\nAffordable access to care\\nSEE MORE\\nAd by AETNA\\n\\nDillashaw said he hopes the fact he’s been out of action for so long will actually play in his favor and, if Yan retains his title on March 6, the former champion is hopeful that Yan will want to face him next.\\n\\n\\nVideo: Curtis Blaydes OK with Jon Jones taking heavyweight title shot _ UFC Fight Night 185.mp4 (SMG)\\n\\nPause\\nCurrent Time 3:32\\n/\\nDuration 10:22\\nUnmute\\n0\\nHQ\\nCaptionsFullscreen\\nCurtis Blaydes OK with Jon Jones taking heavyweight title shot _ UFC Fight Night 185.mp4\\nClick to expand\\n“Maybe he’s thinking me coming back for my first fight might be the best time to catch me as well, too. To try and catch me slipping. But I mean, that’s what I want. The ultimate goal for me is to be the champion. The greatest things come to you when you’re champion, the goal is to be champion, so why not get out there and get it done.”\\n\\nIf Dillashaw doesn’t get the title fight, he’s not short of options. With the likes of Cory Sandhagen and Rob Font both calling him out, the former champion said he’s willing to take out any top-ranked opponent to regain his throne.\\n\\n“I’m in a good situation,” Dillashaw said. “I think everyone in the top five has called me out. I want to come back and fight the best. I’m 35 years old now, I’ve got a lot of things in life going on, so I want to come back and prove that I’m the best bantamweight of all time, and I want to come back and fight the best. If that’s for the belt right away then so be it. If that’s fighting someone else in the top five, awesome.\\n\\n“Every person that’s called me out, I’ve said yes to the UFC, so that’s just showing them that I’m eager to get back in there. So it doesn’t really matter as long as it’s someone that’s at the top of the game, because I’m gonna climb up and get that belt back fast.”',\n",

The head, or mast, will unfold and cameras on the mast will capture more images of the rover\\'s surroundings to provide a panorama, as well as a \"selfie\" panorama of the rover.\\n\\nIngenuity, the little helicopter tucked up under the rover, will also go through a checkup. Before the helicopter can begin its series of test flights over a 30-day period, a lot has to happen and it will take time, Hwang said.\\n\\nThe rover will need to drive to a location, called the helipad location, where it can drop the helicopter on the surface of Mars and roll back away from the helicopter. Perseverance will be able to watch and record images and video of these historic flights. Ingenuity also carries two cameras and will be able to share its aerial views.\\n\\nNow that the rover has landed, it can switch over to the software it will need to use while driving on the Martian surface.\\n\\nThe images sent back by the rover will inform the science team \"so that we can actually begin to really start the mission,\" said Hallie Gengl Abarca, the rover\\'s imaging and data processing team lead for surface operations.\\n\\nKatie Stack Morgan, deputy project scientist for the rover, has been helping to lead a team of 450 scientists around the world as they prepare to explore Jezero Crater. Now, they\\'re ready to study these images and plot out a path for the rover to use as it navigates intriguing features of the crater. \\n\\nPerseverance landed about 1.2 miles away from the river delta feature within Jezero Crater, which hosted a lake 3.9 billion years ago. The rover will spend the next two years investigating the crater and delta in the search for evidence of ancient life that may have existed when Mars was a more habitable place.\\n\\nThe rover will explore nearby rocks on the crater floor to determine if they are volcanic basalt or sedimentary rocks and investigate the presence of a mineral called olivine, Morgan said.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a mineral that is very interesting to us, and thoughts are that this could be an explosive ash deposit deposit into Jezero Crater,\" she said. \"On the other hand, we are in a lake basin and these could be lake sediments that we\\'re seeing.\"\\n\\nHoles present in some the rocks visible in images taken by the rover could suggest either gas that escaped the rocks if they were formed from lava, or fluids that dissolved part of the rock if they\\'re sedimentary.\\n\\n\"Between us and the delta, we have a lot of interesting science to do,\" she said. \"As soon as we got that color image from the surface of Mars, our chats lit up with the science team saying \\'look over here\\' and\\' look over here.\\' And that\\'s exactly what we were hoping for it and we can\\'t believe that we\\'re really doing science now on the surface of Mars.\"',\n",

Britain has delayed administering the second dose for up to three months after the first, opting to offer more people the partial protection of a single shot.\\n\\n\\nBut the study sounded a cautionary note about how long high protection levels from a single dose would last. The risk of hospitalization dropped starting a week after people received their first shot, reaching a low point four to five weeks after they were vaccinated. But then it appeared to rise again.\\n\\nThe scientists who conducted the study said it was too early to know whether the protection offered by a single dose waned after a month, cautioning that more evidence was needed.\\n\\nThe findings in Scotland bolstered earlier results from Israel showing that the vaccines offered significant protection from the virus. The Israeli studies have focused on the Pfizer vaccine, but the Scottish study extended to the AstraZeneca shot, which has been administered in Britain since early January. The AstraZeneca shot is the backbone of many nations’ inoculation plans: It is far cheaper to produce, and can be shipped and stored in normal refrigerators rather than the ultracold freezers used for other vaccines.\\n\\n“Both of these are working spectacularly well,” Aziz Sheikh, a professor at the University of Edinburgh who was involved in the study, said at a news conference on Monday.\\n\\nThe researchers in Scotland examined roughly 8,000 coronavirus-related hospital admissions, and studied how the risk of hospitalization differed among people who had and had not received a shot. Over all, more than 1.1 million people were vaccinated in the period the researchers were studying.\\n\\nThe numbers of vaccinated people who sought care in hospitals was too small to compare the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, or to give precise figures for their effectiveness, the researchers said.\\n\\nBut from 28 to 34 days after the first shot, the AstraZeneca vaccine reduced the risk of Covid-19 hospital admissions by roughly 94 percent. In that same time period, the Pfizer vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalizations by roughly 85 percent. In both cases, those figures fit within a broad range of possible effects.\\n\\nBecause the Pfizer vaccine was authorized in Britain before the AstraZeneca shot, the researchers had more data on the Pfizer vaccine, and found that the protection against hospital admissions was somewhat reduced at longer periods after the first shot.\\n\\n“The peak protection is at four weeks, and then it starts to drop away,” said Simon Clarke, a professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading who was not involved in the study.\\n\\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine has faced skepticism in parts of Europe after many countries chose not to give it to older people, citing a lack of clinical trial data in that group. The Scottish study could not offer precise figures on that vaccine’s effectiveness in older people.
